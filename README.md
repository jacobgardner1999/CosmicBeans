# Cosmic Beans

## Initial Idea
Cosmic Beans is a text based choice game. It revolves around a mysterious new coffee shop and has the player uncovering 
secrets about the owners through comedic scenarios. There are multiple ending and a traits system blocking certain paths
based on the players prior decisions.

## Tech Stack
The project is entirely written in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI. It uses Maven as a build tool. 

## Collaborators
This project is being worked on as a joint project between Jacob Gardner and Amara Relf.
